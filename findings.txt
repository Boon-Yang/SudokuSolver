Summarise your findings here (see specification).

Note: Current results were obtained by stepping through the digits in
ascending order, one may get different figures by reversing the order.

By the number of recursive calls,
mystery1 is extremely hard -> 421547 calls
mystery2 is impossible to be solved,
mystery3 is hard -> 14134 calls.

The number of recursive calls increases with the number of backtracking performed.
With more number of recursive calls, more memory has to be allocated
to store the call stacks in the stack frame. If one solves the puzzle
by hand following exactly the recursive backtracking algorithm, the puzzles with more
recursive calls also mean that more trial-and-error has to be
performed. Hence, they are harder to be solved.
